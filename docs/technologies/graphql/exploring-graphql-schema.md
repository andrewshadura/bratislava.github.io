# Exploring GraphQL Schemas

You can use [our fork](https://github.com/bratislava/graphiql-explorer-example) of the [OneGraph GraphiQL Explorer](https://github.com/OneGraph/graphiql-explorer-example) to browse any GraphQL endpoint. In our case it's usually an endpoint of a Strapi instance. The only thing our fork adds is easy configuration of the endpoint via `.env`.

You can use the left panel to easily explore through all of the options provided by the api, and use the params to control filtering/sorting/pagination.
