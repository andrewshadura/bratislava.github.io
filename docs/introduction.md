# Introduction

> ðŸ”§ This site is under active development - if you'd like to contribute, get in touch via [email](mailto:innovationteam@bratislava.sk) or [github](https://github.com/bratislava/bratislava.github.io)

This site is maintained by the [Department of Innovation and Technology of the City of Bratislava](https://inovacie.bratislava.sk). We believe in making public-sector code open source, promoting [savings, collaboration, auditability and innovation](https://publiccode.eu).

Our goal is to be transparent about services weâ€™re developing and providing, as well as to invite other cities and municipalities to build on top of the same or similar open-source technologies weâ€™ve already tested and used - to foster an ecosystem of collaboration between teams facing similar challenges. Weâ€™ll be happy to [get in touch.](mailto:innovationteam@bratislava.sk)

We intend to make many more of our projects open-source by the end of 2022 - stay tuned!

> If you are an individual or a company whoâ€™d like to take part in these efforts, collaborate closely on development or report an issue, weâ€™d love to hear from you! ðŸ™Œ Contact us using this repository or at [innovationteam@bratislava.sk](mailto:innovationteam@bratislava.sk)
